-  Composition is the chaining of [[functions]] 
> **Definition: Composition.**: If $f:C\to D$ and $g: A \to B$ are two mapping with $B \subset C$, then the *composition* $(f \circ g): A \to D$ is the mapping given by
>
$$
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))
$$
- The codomain of the first function $g$, has to be within the domain of the second function $f$
> Proposition: Composition is associative. 
$$
(f \circ g)\circ h = f \circ ( g \circ h)
$$
- The idea of composition can also be applied to [[linear transformations]] and [[matrices]]
	- For linear transformations, we can show a composition through left multiplication by a matrix
