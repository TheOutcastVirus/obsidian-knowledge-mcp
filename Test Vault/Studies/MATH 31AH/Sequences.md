- A sequence is an infinite list
	- numbers, vectors, or matrices
> **Definition 0.4.7 (Convergent sequence).** A sequence $a_{n}$ of real numbers is said to converge to the limit $a$ if for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that for $n>N$, we have $|a-a_{n}|<\epsilon$.
- This is saying that for any small distance $\epsilon$, we can find that starting at some point in the sequence ($n>N$) that the difference between the limit $a$ and the sequence term $a_{n}$ will be smaller than the distance $\epsilon$
- Many important sequences appear as partial sums of [[Series]]
