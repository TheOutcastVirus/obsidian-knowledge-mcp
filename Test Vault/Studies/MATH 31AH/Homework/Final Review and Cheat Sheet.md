## Past exams
### Midterm 1
- Problem 1
	- Intersection of sub spaces is also a subspace
	- Set that spans $n$ dimensions will have at least $n$ linearly independent elements
	- A linear map can only have multiple inputs map to the same output if and only if they map to zero. There is no other possible overlap of outputs. Therefore, T for some $T(x)\neq 0$ is injective.
- Problem 2
	- Missed non empty in the definition of linear subspace
	- Mistake in proving that $S_{1}+S_{2}$ is a linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$
- Problem 3
	- Mistake in solving system of linear equations using matrix
	- Mistake in computing inverse of matrix
- Problem 4
	- Finding matrix representation of transformation from example calculations
	- Definition of linear map
- Problem 5
	- Mistake in defining make from $\mathbb{N}^3\to \mathbb{N}$ for Schroder-Bernstein
	- Did not define a map from $\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}^3$

### Midterm 2
- Problem 1
	- Definition of $S^\perp$
	- Finding $S^\perp$ for some set 
	- Showing linearity of transformation that uses the dot product (bi linearity)
- Problem 2
	- Definition of cross product in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with determinant
	- Showing orthogonality of cross product
	- Calculating 4 by 4 determinant
- Problem 3
