- A series is a [[Sequences|sequence]] where the terms are added. 
$$
s_{N} = \sum_{n=1}^N a_{n}
$$
> **Definition 0.4.8 (Convergent series).** If the sequence of partial sums of a series has a limit $S$, we say that the series converges, and its limit is
> 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}=S
$$
- For a geometric series in the following form, the sum is equal to 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n=\frac{a}{1-r}
$$
