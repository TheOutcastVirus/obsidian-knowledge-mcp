# Magnetism
Magnetism is a fundamental force arising from the motion of electric charges and the intrinsic spin of particles.
It manifests in various phenomena such as:
- Attraction and repulsion between magnets
- Magnetic fields around current‑carrying conductors
- Earth's geomagnetic field

## Key Concepts
1. **Magnetic Field (B)** – A vector field describing magnetic influence.
2. **Magnetization (M)** – Density of magnetic dipole moments in a material.
3. **Faraday’s Law** – Changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force.

## Applications
- Electric motors and generators
- Magnetic storage media
- MRI machines
