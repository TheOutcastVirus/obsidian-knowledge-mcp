I see the term ‘second brain’ thrown around a lot when it comes to discussion about Obsidian and Zettelkasten, and I want to expand on what that means to me and how that defines the purpose of this big experiment.

AI/robotic likenesses of people are commonplace in science fiction; take Cortana from Halo, Clovis Bray from Destiny, or Hari Seldon from The Foundation. All of these intelligences were created through transferring thoughts from a brain to a computer, and feeding that into some sort of generative algorithm. 

I think we are really close to such a future. Llama might not be the most sophisticated AI models, but even they can do a good job of absorbing content and impersonating people. Of course we can’t scan brains yet, but I think something like my vault here in should work just as well (in theory) for such an algorithm. Here’s why:

1. At its most basic form, these notes will consider a general gist of day to day happenings, going into more detail if something out of the ordinary happens.
2. It contains a log of my feelings and what I’m thinking in the moment. I do not shy away from writing about strong or negative emotions here at all.
3. It contains random thoughts, ideas, aspirations, and goals of mine. I believe that a persons goals in life are what define them, more than anything. If my amateur philosophical musings hold true, this journal is full of what defines me.
4. Is all written by me, for me, as well. I have written this for no one else but me, and as a result I am free to talk about whatever I think about. The only reason that I write formally here is not because this is for other people, but because this is also a long running exercise in writing.
