I found [this](https://bryanhogan.com/blog/obsidian-zettelkasten) blog that suggested that the best way to organize your notes, was to work down up, instead of top down. 

The article talked about how we work on notes in a top down fashion, where we define different folders to put notes in, and define section headers and subfolders and so on. It talked about how this can be counterproductive, and how it can lead 

Rather, a Zettel is an atomic piece of knowledge, the lowest common denominator. It can thought of as a notecard of information. A Zettelkasten is made up of a collection of these notecards. The structure of the Zettelkasten emerges from the connections between the cards. The Zettelkasten system utilizes Obsidian's graph feature to easily visualize these connections. 

I have, unknowingly, been emulating a system similar to a Zettelkasten so far. Each note is its own self contained though, with links to other notes.
