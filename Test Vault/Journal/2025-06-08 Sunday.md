Today was the second full day (third overall day) that we spent in Maui. We started the day off heading to Lahaina, a major town in west Maui that was devastated by a wildfire. I refused to go into the burnt area of town out of respect for the locals. We went to eat at Aloha Mixed Plate, where we had a reservation for brunch at 10 AM. We ate a hearty meal and set off to east Maui.

Confused on what to do, we went on the road to Hana, a town on the easternmost side of the island, we thought we could make it at first, but we soon realized that it would take too long. Along the way, we stopped for some waterfalls, located on a tropical nature farm with great scenery. We then took a short break at a nature trail, and went to an arboretum. The arboretum had great views of another waterfall and the valley, as well of plenty of exotic trees, both ornamental and fruit bearing. My parents and grandparents were giddy to take as many fruits as they could get away with; and it showed a generational difference on how we valued fruit.
