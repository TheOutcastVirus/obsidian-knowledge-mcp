It was on September 10th, 2025 that I found out that Charlie Kirk had be assassinated when an notification popped up on my Alex. My instant reaction was, "he was going to die someday", but I didn't fully process it at the moment.

I sat down and went through the news, the realization came to me. This was a full blown assassination of a political commentator. It was a figure I had know (and hated) for a long, long time. I realized that this kind of killing was unprecedented in the modern day. 

I also learned that there had been many recordings of the video of his death. I heard from people online and Tarun that the video was particularly gruesome and disturbing. I'm glad I stayed away from it. 

The right has been blaming the left, and the left's response has been from anywhere from saying it was deserved (as Kirk was a staunch supporter of gun rights) to completely denouncing the attack. 

I'm worried what this will mean for the increasingly polarized and heated political discourse we have been seeing, as well as what it means for the freedom of political speech.
