In dystopian lit, we had a lecture from Ms Shi about propaganda, and the direction of hate towards ‘the other’  in order to keep the powerful in power. She used examples of different presidential campaigns that past presidents ran. One particular one about George Bush and the war on terror really made me think about America from a historical and civilization perspective. She talks about how 9/11 made people realize that America was not invincible and could be hurt. With current events with the Trump presidency and foreign affairs, people are starting to think that the American hegemony about to come to an end. Looking at American history from a outsider’s historical perspective allowed me to decouple from my personal biases and have a different view on things.
